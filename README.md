First_Unity_Game
================

Synopsis: This is a puzzle platformer where you play as a block named "Blue", you must avoid the enemy "Reds" and get to the goal.

This was created based upon a tutorial, and then it started moving into its own thing and not just some experiment. So that means a few things:

1. There are going to be some planned features
2. The game is going to go into a non-scheduled update cycle 
3. Game will have, at some point...
  * Characters models
  * Bosses
  * More mechanics
  * Spikes
  
Plans for next version:

1. A
	 - [X] List item
2. Add more levels
  - [ ] Add Level 6
  - [ ] Add Level 7
  - [ ] Add Level 8
  - [ ] Add Level 9
  - [ ] Add Level 10
