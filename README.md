My first Unity Game

~Developement continued! (AGAIN! [May2015])~

Synopsis: This is a puzzle platformer where you play as a block named "Blue", you must avoid the enemy "Reds" and get to the goal.

This was created based upon a tutorial, but is accually turning into a REAL game, and not just some experiment. So that means a few things:

1. There are going to be some planned features
2. The game is going to go into a non-scheduled update cycle 
3. Game will have, at some point...
  * Characters models
  * Bosses
  * More mechanics
  * Spikes 'n' stuff!

Tune into here for more news 'n' stuff.
